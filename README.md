I'M CRYING THIS IS FRYING ME... Like I was just complaining to my partner and some random attacked me.. like bud just say it to my face I won't just block you for that, I'll talk it out but nooo you wanan do this... I'm keepign this here forever omg people need to see this.

Oh and side note they didn't know the situation.. so I'll say it here ;-;..
To answer yeah it wouldn't be evesdropping if they were near but they were pretty far away from me (I had to zoom out thrice to see them) And side note me and them are sort of friend(s) now cause we had a chat... unlike you who's being Anonymous. It's kinda immature of you bud, but hey it isn't too late to step up and chat about this with me ^_^
Update: Turns out it was my friend's friend... They apolgized (after we<me & our mutual> had to force them to apolgize...), but not only that, they were being really really immature about this, I'm keeping this here for memory so people can probably think before they speak...
